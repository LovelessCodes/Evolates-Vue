# Evolates-Vue
An elegant single-page web application to display a countdown and create hype for an NFT project.

## Why?
I was ordered by a person to create a small singlepage web application for them to display their new NFT.       
        
What was required from this singlepage web application:
- Should include:
  - Navigation bar
  - Header w/ a background
    - Button to display a date or a countdown
  - About
  - Roadmap
  - Team
  - FAQ
  - Footer w/ a link to Solana
- Single Page
- Easy Configuration
       
I've changed the FAQ section, from what I delivered to the person - since I disagreed with them on the styling.      
They wanted it plain white - no accordion. Which I thought looked awful, so I came up with this - which they didn't want in their version.
